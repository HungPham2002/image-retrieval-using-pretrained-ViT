Apply pre-trained Vision transformer to retrieve images
## Introduction:

An image retrieval system is a computer system used for browsing, searching and retrieving images from a large database of digital images.

## Project Statement: 

Given a list of images, build an image retrieval system that finds relevant or similar images among
the source images compared to the query image.

Feature Extractor: A component (typically a network) that is automatically identifying and extracting meaningful features from raw image data. Some well-known extractor are:
  - Digital Image Processing: HOG, SIFT...
  - Traditional Machine Learning: Bag of Visual Words, PCA...
  - Deep Learning: CNNs, Autoencoder, ViT...

# Apply pre-trained ViT:
Vision Transformer (ViT): A deep learning architecture designed for image classification tasks. ViT deviates from traditional CNNs by using a transformer-based architecture.
